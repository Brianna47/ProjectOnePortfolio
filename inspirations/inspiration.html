<h4><em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/ghetto.rodeo?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw==">--Brian Saucedo--</a></em></h4>
<p>Brian is the creator of the Los Angeles brand Ghetto Rodeo who uses his culture as his main source of inspiration and to spread advocacy about issues pertaining to what may be happening or has been happening to his people. I had distanced myself before from relating to along of things to my hispanic culture but as I grew up I really learned to appreciate many little aspects from my culture and especially the fashion inspiring me to create and incorporate hispanic fashions into my everyday wardrobe</p>

<p>I really love the deisgns of this specific designer as she revolves her designs on childhood nostolgia and reliving some of the things she wore as a kid into her looks in a more sopisticated but yet playful way</p>

<h4><em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/genaaaai?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw==">--Genai Nakama--</a></em></h4>
<p>Genai is an online content creator who is half Mexican and half Japanese and started her presence online to be the represent she did not see when she was growing up. She defys socities social standards by constantly challenging her style and mixing very feminine and masculine pieces together which many were afraid of before but now is much more common now. I have learned from her that it is okay to mix it up and try new things that would not typically be styled together which makes things much more fun</p>
