<p>Brianna is a 21 years old attending San Francisco State University majoring in Apparel Merchandising. She is in her last year of for her degree and always had such a strong connection towards fashion and the industry overall which led her to pursue it more in college. She is interested in fashion which her interest began at a really young age and enjoys how versitile the industry is hence is why she decided to pursue this further.<br>
    She is originally from a town called soledad but has been living in San Francisco for three years now and absolutely loves the city. she spends most of her time exploring the city as much as she can, as this was a whole new area to her and thought that there would not be enough time to be able to explore the whole city. She enjoys wandering around different neighborboods and finding new small shops that have such unique items that could not be found elsewhere. She also enjoys candid photography, so you would find her wondering around with her camera taking photos of whatever caught her attention. The individuality of people here and the communities is what ultimately drove her choice for wanting to live in San Francisco and cannot compare to her small hometown.<br>
    
    Before moving to San Francisco she lived in Soledad which is a more rural area, surrounded by nothing much other than agriculture. Despite the area she was pretty lucky to be able to visit many places that surrounded Soledad such as Monterey, which has an amazing aquarium and fun antique shops. As well as not being too far from Santa Cruz, which is where she was born. Her favorite spot to visit was downtown Santa Cruz area as there is a whole section dedicate to a wide selection of different shops and art. The boardwalk also is not far from downtown and has really fun attractions that she grew up going around. <br>
